FOR NEW REPOSITORY

after creating REPOSITORY in git hub copy the link 
now open vs code click on new terminal
after that write 
1. git init                      (this will make make empty repository in git )
2. git add .                     (this will add the files into empty repository)
3. git commit -m "title name"    (this will commit the files to be push in git hub from vs studio)
4. git remote add origin 'link'  (first we have to give link of the git so that the files will push into that link)
5. git push origin master        (now all the code will push into git hub)

FOR ALREADY EXISTING REPOSITORY 

git commit -m  "title name"
git remote add origin https://github.com/PratikGadhe/C-Langauge-2025.git
git branch -m main
git push -u origin main
